    <ol>
      <li>
        Before starting the sauce prepare the Szechuan peppercorns by toasting
        around 2 tablespoons in a saut√© pan over medium heat for 5 minutes or
        until fragrant and slightly darkened.<br />
        Grind the toasted peppercorns in a spice grinder, coffee grinder, or
        mortar and pestle until fine, and then sift it through a wire mesh
        strainer to remove the big pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce by combining 1 cup of water with soy sauce, sesame oil,
        ginger, garlic and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat.<br />
        When the mixture begins to bubble reduce the heat and simmer for 12
        minutes.<br />
        Cover the pan and let the mixture steep for 12 minutes, then pour the
        sauce through a wire mesh strainer. Add the strained sauce back into the
        saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch into the remaining 1/2 cup of water
        until dissolved. Pour this slurry into the saucepan along with the
        sugar, ground Szechuan peppercorns, black pepper, and coriander.<br />
        Heat over medium until bubbling, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3
        minutes. It should be much thicker. Remove the sauce from the heat and
        let it cool for 3 minutes, uncovered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the vinegars and lime juice, and let it cool down before using.<br />
        Store the sauce covered in your refrigerator and it will last for
        several weeks. Stir well before using.
