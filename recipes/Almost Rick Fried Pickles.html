        <h4>Recipe Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat 1 1/2-2 inches oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium-high
            heat to 375-degrees F.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a shallow bowl or rimmed plate, whisk together flour, Italian
            seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Add hot sauce and water
            and mix until smooth.

            Working in batches, add dried pickles to the batter, gently toss to
            coat. Using a slotted spoon, remove pickles from the batter and let
            excess drip off.<br />
            Gently add pickles to the oil one at a time.<br />
            Fry for about 1 1/2-2 minutes or until golden.<br />
